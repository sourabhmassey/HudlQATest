# HudlQATest
This is a Selenium Framework to test the login and landing pages

There 2 projects HudlTestFrameworks (ignore the "s") it was to differentiate bhetween projects. and HudlQATest.

This is also the name of the Solution. 

The projects are in HudlClientTest.csproj

I have created scenarios for the login as well as some for the main landing page.

I have tried setting up the workflow as well but am more well versed with azure DevOps
